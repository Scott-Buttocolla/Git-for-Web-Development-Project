		go to github and find the repo you want to clone
		Create our own repo (fork)
		Check for our name included after the fork on the "new" repo
		Get the clone address from the clone or download button
		open git/gitbash and go to the directory you want to place the repo
		git clone ( place clone address here)
		cd ( repo name)
		git checkout -b "firstname-lastname"    opens up branch you to start making changes, must have "" around name
		make your changes to the files and save them where you opened them
		git add .     will add your changes
		git status will show you if the changes were implimented
		git commit -m "what are your changes"   must have "" around changes
		git push -u origin firstname-lastname    does not need "" around name
		go back to github where you forked the project
		make sure you submit for your repo and not the main repo you cloned from
			check branch tab to pull the correct branch
		submit a pull request
		Click the dropdown button where it says base repo and change to your forked rep
		Add someone as the reviewer if necessary ( not currently used by Lambda
		DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST


Stretch Questions
